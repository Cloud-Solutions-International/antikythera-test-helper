# antikythera-test-helper
A set of classes to help with the antikythera test suites.

These classes should be compiled and imported into the main antikythera project. While antikythera is mostly about working with java source code, a class that's available in source form can and will extend classes that are available only in binary form. These need to be handled properly by the expression evaluation engine and therefore need to be tested as well.
